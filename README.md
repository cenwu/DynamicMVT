# DynamicMVT
Codes of a robust multivariate t distribution mapping framework for QTL identification in functional mapping.

# Algorithm
Robust (multivariate t) EM algorithms for mixture models.
Similar algorithms based on multivariate Laplacian distributions have also been developed.

# Usage
Simulation results in the above paper can be reproduced by using the codes above.
mvnn.r: Data have been generated by using multivariae normal distribution, and then fitted by mixture model with multivariate normal assumption.
mvnt.r: Data have been generated by using multivariae normal distribution, and then fitted by mixture model with multivariate t assumption.
mvtn.r: Data have been generated by using multivariae t distribution, and then fitted by mixture model with multivariate normal assumption.
mvtt.r: Data have been generated by using multivariae t distribution, and then fitted by mixture model with multivariate t assumption.
